# Examples

These are examples that show the progress of the `ci` system. All examples work
because all examples are tests.

- In JS/TS examples, the are `assert` statements.
- In the YAML examples, a new property ()`assert`) has been added for `task` to
  ensure the output is correct.

All the examples currently run under [`main_test.go`](../main_test.go) to ensure
the assertions are run with any code changes.
